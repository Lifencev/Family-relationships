# Family Relations Project

This project explores the representation and querying of family relations using three different programming languages: Java, Prolog, and SQL.

## Project Structure

The project contains the following files:

* **`Java_family_relations_Lifientsiev.java`**:
    * This file contains a Java program that implements data structures for representing and querying family relations. It involves object-oriented programming to model individuals and their relationships.
* **`Prolog_family_relations_Lifientsiev.pl`**:
    * This file contains a Prolog program that uses logical rules and facts to define and query family relations. Prolog's logic programming paradigm is well-suited for representing such relationships.
* **`SQL_family_relations_Lifientsiev.sql`**:
    * This file contains SQL scripts to create a relational database schema for storing family relationships. It includes tables for individuals and relationships, and SQL queries to retrieve information.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how the same problem (representing and querying family relations) can be approached using different programming paradigms.

* **Java**: Offers an imperative and object-oriented approach, allowing for structured data representation and procedural logic.
* **Prolog**: Provides a declarative logic-based approach, where relationships are defined as rules and facts, and queries are answered through logical inference.
* **SQL**: Employs a declarative relational database approach, where data is stored in tables and queried using structured query language.

## Usage

To use this project:

1.  **Java**: Compile and run `Java_family_relations_Lifientsiev.java` using a Java Development Kit (JDK).
2.  **Prolog**: Load and query `Prolog_family_relations_Lifientsiev.pl` using a Prolog interpreter (e.g., SWI-Prolog).
3.  **SQL**: Execute the SQL scripts in `SQL_family_relations_Lifientsiev.sql` against a relational database management system (RDBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite.

## Further Exploration

* Compare the efficiency and expressiveness of each approach.
* Extend the project to handle more complex family relationships or queries.
